# Telecom-Churn-Data-Analysis

### Business Problem:

#### Overview
In the telecom industry, customers are able to choose from multiple service providers and actively switch from one operator to another. In this highly competitive market, the telecommunications industry experiences an average of 15-25% annual churn rate. Given the fact that it costs 5-10 times more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one, customer retention has now become even more important than customer acquisition.

The analysis is divided into below parts:

<br>1. Data Sourcing or Data Understanding

<br>4. Model Preparation
<br>5. Train and Test Data Split
<br>6. Data Normalization
<br>7. Handling Class Imbalance
<br>8. Model Building
<br>9. Residual Analysis of the Train Data
<br>10. Making Predictions
